# B58 Spaceship Game
 
 This is my B58 final project which is a spaceship game where the objective is to survive as long as you can. The game was built in assembly on the MIPs processor.
 
 Users can move up down left and right, they have to dodge obstacles and the game's difficulty increases as time progresses!
